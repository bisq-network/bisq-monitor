/**
 * We execute all tasks serial. Once all tasks are completed we check if we have passed the min. interval time and if
 * so we repeat running all tasks. It can be that tasks have their own interval time not passed and skip execution.
 * If we are too fast we put the thread on sleep for the interval time to not execute the while loop too often.
 * There is no guarantee for tasks that their interval gets met if the sum of all other tasks take longer.
 * But there is a guarantee that the task will not execute faster as the defined interval.
 * The reason why we do not want to have parallel execution here is that tasks could interfere each other's results
 * if Tor network get more load from parallel tasks. We prefer to have the tasks in isolated conditions to get more
 * reliable results.
